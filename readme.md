# Newsletter signup

User enters first name, last name and email into html form and recieves the response page to confirm if the request was successful.  Data is sent to mailchimp server using their API. I have used the following technologies: HTML, Bootstrap CSS, Node.js with Express. Should redesign the main page if i am to show it in a portfolio.
